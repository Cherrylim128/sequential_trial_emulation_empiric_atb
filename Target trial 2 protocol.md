# Protocol of target sequential trial 2
| Protocol component | Target sequential trial | Emulation using data of a prospective surveillance study on HAI in a Thai tertiary hospital |
| :--- | :--- | :---  |
| **Eligibility criteria**  | **Inclusion criteria** (all must met) <br>1. Hospitalised <br>2. Met the definition of hospital-acquired infection based on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance guidelines <br>3. At least one of the 7 priority pathogens identified in at last one clinical sample <br>4. Antibiotic exposure on the day of clinical sample collection (but could have received antibiotics previously) <br>5. Had antibiotic treatment for infection the day prior to enrolment <br><br>**Exclusion criteria** (at least one) <br>1. Individuals who started with “Reserve” antibiotics on time t=0 (assuming those needed “Reserve” antibiotics in this population are severe) <br>2. Patients have not enrolled to this trial before |The target sequential trial is emulated using data of a prospective surveillance study on HAI in a Thai tertiary hospital. <br><br>The eliginility criteria were as in target trial. <br><br> Time *t* = 0 was the time at which the clinical sample was collected for microbiological testing. Trial has been performed at *t* = 1, 2. |
| **Treatment strategies**  | 1. Continue with the same type of antibiotic (regardless of dosage or frequency) at *t* = 1, 2; <br>3. Step-down to a “more narrow-spectrum antibiotic” based on the AWaRe classification at *t* = 1, 2; or <br>3. Step-up to a “more broad-spectrum antibiotic” based on the AWaRe classification at *t* = 1, 2.  |  The treatment strategies of interest were as in the target trial. |
| **Assignment procedures** | Patients randomly assigned to one of the three treatment strategies. Neither the patients nor their health care teams are blinded to the treatment status. | At each visit (*t* = 1, 2) a patient either continued the empiric antibiotic from the same AWaRe group or switch to another group. We assumed that empiric antibiotic prescription was informed by the following covariates, which are also assumed to affect the outcome: sex, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, date of week, time of admission, time since admission to t=0, admission method, referred from other hospital, cumulative days on antibiotic prior to t=0, year of admission, type of infection that resulted in antibiotic treatment, on invasive device prior to *t* = 0, results from microbiology testing, and past antibiotic use, past SOFA score and past ICU admission. Neither the patients nor their health care teams are blinded to the treatment status. |
| **Follow-up period** | Starts at randomisation and ends at death, loss-to follow-up, or 28-day of follow-up, whichever happens first. | A trial was performed at *t* = 1, 2. At two trials included patients who met the trial emulation eligibility criteria at *t* = 1, 2, respectively. In each trial follow-up starts at time *t* and ends at switching away from the treatment  at visit *t*+1, death, loss-to follow-up, or 28-day of follow-up, whichever happens first. |
| **Design** | Sequential trial: screening for eligibility criteria, enrollment and randomisation took place at two timepoints (*t* = 1, 2). | The design was as in the target trial and randomisation performed at *t* = 1, 2. |
| **Outcome** | 28-day mortality | As in the target trial |
| **Causal contrast** | Per-protocol treatment effect. <br>Marginal 28-day mortality under the three treatment strategies, and corresponding marginal risk differences. | The causal contrasts of interest were as in the target trial. |
