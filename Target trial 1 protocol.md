# Protocol of target sequential trial 1

| Protocol component    | Target sequential trial | Emulation of the target sequential trial using electronic health record of Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database |
| :--- | :--- | :---  |
| **Eligibility criteria**  | **Inclusion criteria** (all must met) <br>1. Hospitalised <br>2. Aged ≥12 years old <br>3. Not exposed to antibiotic treatment for infection or for suspected infection within the first two 48 hours of hospitalisation Antibiotics initiated at some point during hospitalisation at least 48h after hospital admission with a treatment indication <br>4. Had antibiotic treatment for infection the day prior to enrolment <br><br>**Exclusion criteria** (at least one) <br>1. Admitted to maternity ward <br>2. Individuals who started with “Reserve” antibiotics on time t=0 (assuming those needed “Reserve” antibiotics in this population are severe) <br>3. Patients have not enrolled to this trial before <br>4. Prophylactic antibiotic.|The target sequential trial is emulated using electronic health record of Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database between 2015 and 2022. <br>The eliginility criteria were as in target trial. <br><br> Time *t* = 0 was the time at which the first antibiotic was prescribed for treatment (at least 48h after hospital admission). Trial has been performed at *t* = 1, 2. |
| **Treatment strategies**  | 1. Continue with the same type of antibiotic (regardless of dosage or frequency) at *t* = 1, 2; <br>3. Step-down to a “more narrow-spectrum antibiotic” based on the AWaRe classification at *t* = 1, 2; or <br>3. Step-up to a “more broad-spectrum antibiotic” based on the AWaRe classification at *t* = 1, 2.  |  The treatment strategies of interest were as in the target trial. |
| **Assignment procedures** | Patients randomly assigned to one of the three treatment strategies. Neither the patients nor their health care teams are blinded to the treatment status. | xxx |
| **Follow-up period** | Starts at randomisation (*t* = 1) and ends at death, loss-to follow-up, or 28-day of follow-up, whichever happens first. | xxx |
| **Design** | Sequential trial: screening for eligibility criteria, enrollment and randomisation took place at two timepoints (*t* = 1, 2). | xxx |
| **Outcome** | 28-day mortality | xxx |
| **Causal contrast** | Per-protocol treatment effect. <br>Marginal 28-day mortality under the three treatment strategies, and corresponding marginal risk differences. | xxx |
